Market-leading low latencies support individual use cases and workflows.\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n What is the Brave Search API?\\n\\n The Brave Search API is a developer tool for building applications with data from the Web. It’s powered by Brave’s independent Web index, the same index that powers [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com). It’s commonly used in traditional search engine products, AI search engines, AI training, and agentic (autonomous AI) search.\\n\\n Why is a credit card required to subscribe to a free plan?\\n\\n The credit card requirement serves as an anti-fraud measure to protect Brave from bad actors who want to abuse our API. For free plans, the card is only used to confirm your identity and will not be charged.\\n\\n What other web search API options can the Brave Search API compliment or replace?\\n\\n The Brave Search API can replace several competing options that may have smaller indexes (Tavily or Exa), higher latencies (SerpAPI or Serper), or more limited access (Google and Bing). It can also serve as a complement to localized API options like Baidu, Naver, Yahoo, and Yandex. The Brave Search API is powered by Brave Search, a completely independent index of the Web, which is tuned to reduce SEO spam and increase quality and recency of results.\\n\\n Where does the data come from?\\n\\nEvery search engine that has its own index necessarily has its own Web crawler. The Brave Search crawler does not advertise a differentiated user-agent because we must avoid discrimination from websites that allow only Google to crawl them. However, if a domain or page is not crawlable by any search engine (e.g. because it has a noindex tag), or if it is not crawlable by googlebot, then Brave Search’s bot will not crawl it either.\\n\\nBrave Search is also built on more than just Web crawlers: its privacy-preserving [Web Discovery Project](https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project) (WDP) allows Brave browser users to opt in and contribute data about searches and webpage visits. This level of voluntary human contribution to an index is unique in the world of API search and training data. WDP uses several privacy safeguards to prevent Brave from knowing who is contributing what, and the code is [open-source](https://github.com/brave/web-discovery-project) for auditing by anyone.\\n\\n What are the key benefits of the Brave Search API?\\n\\nThe Brave Search API offers world-class search engine capabilities at a significantly lower cost to other Search and AI Search APIs. The data is fresh, high-quality, and scales with small to large businesses. The Brave Search API is provisioned to manage thousands of requests per second (and growing) and offers customers the speed and reliability necessary for applications with millions of users around the world.\\n\\nImportantly, the Brave Search API is not a scraper that simply uses bots to query Google or Bing and repackage their results. Instead, it’s our own independent index of the Web packaged with our own ranking models.\\n\\n Does the Brave Search API surface recent events?\\n\\n Yes. Brave Search fetches millions of webpages every day, offering extensive coverage of recent events around the world.\\n\\n Can I store results retrieved from the Brave Search API?\\n\\n If you would like to store the API results in part or whole (for example, to train or tune an LLM), you will need to subscribe to a plan that explicitly grants storage rights. Plans with storage rights grant special permissions which are not covered in our general [Terms of Service](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/documentation/resources/terms-of-service).\\n\\n What about copyright?\\n\\nBrave Search API offers a ranked list of webpages that are publicly available; this list also includes information to support why the webpage is relevant to the query (for instance, via query-dependent snippets based on the content of the webpage).\\n\\nThe Brave Search API does not grant any rights to third-party content such as webpages.

Brave Search fetches millions of webpages every day, offering extensive coverage of recent events around the world.\n\n Can I store results retrieved from the Brave Search API?\n\n If you would like to store the API results in part or whole (for example, to train or tune an LLM), you will need to subscribe to a plan that explicitly grants storage rights. Plans with storage rights grant special permissions which are not covered in our general [Terms of Service](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/documentation/resources/terms-of-service).\n\n What about copyright?\n\nBrave Search API offers a ranked list of webpages that are publicly available; this list also includes information to support why the webpage is relevant to the query (for instance, via query-dependent snippets based on the content of the webpage).\n\nThe Brave Search API does not grant any rights to third-party content such as webpages. Customers who access URLs displayed in the Brave Search API must ensure their access to those webpages complies with the copyright terms of the page publishers.\n\n Does the Brave Search API follow security and privacy best practices?\n<<<END_EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT id=\"621de3fee50865b5\">>>"},"isError":false,"timestamp":1771980671900}}
